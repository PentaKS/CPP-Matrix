----Greetings to you, it is my program that can deal with matrix operations----
mainly the operations include
1. formation of a matrix via a SQmatrix class(currently limited to square matrices)
2. assigning values to your matrix as rows
3. transpose of a matrix by SQtranspose use SQprint_transpose to print it (also commented in code)
4. martix multiplications as m1 * m2 where m1 and m2 are different SQmatrix classes
5. you can find determinant of a matrix

it also has some passive features like:
1. printing an identity via identity_print(order) function or use identity as matrix via identity() function
2. also the SQdefault to accomodate and auto assign the rest of values to 0 if order is larger than the assigned values in rows
3. it can also convert a matrix to it's echelon form 

to run the code use g++ matrix.cpp -o matric.exe




///////////// currently the program is completed from my side
